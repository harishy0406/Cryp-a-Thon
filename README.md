# 🔐 IoT FortiGuard - Security Framework for IoT Devices

Welcome to **IoT FortiGuard**, a comprehensive security framework designed to protect IoT devices from prevalent cyber threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, DDoS attacks, and DNS spoofing. This project integrates **secure authentication protocols**, **strong encryption**, **DDoS mitigation**, and **secure API management** to safeguard the integrity of IoT networks.

## 🚀 Features

- **🔒 AES Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data to prevent unauthorized access.
- **🛡️ Secure Authentication**: Multi-layered defense strategy against threats.
- **📈 Traffic Analysis**: Real-time monitoring and anomaly detection.
- **📂 Toolkit**: A collection of tools for various security tasks.
- **👥 Team Information**: Details of the team members behind this project.
- **🌐 GitHub Integration**: Easy access to the project’s GitHub repository.

## 🖥️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started with the project, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harishy0406/Cryp-a-Thon.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

You need to install the following Python packages to run the application:

- PyQt5
- subprocess
- pycryptodome

Use the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pyqt5 pycryptodome
```

### 3. Running the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can run the application with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the **IoT FortiGuard** application, starting with a splash screen followed by the main window, which provides access to various tools and information.

## 🛠️ Toolkit Features

Once the main window is loaded, you can access the **Toolkit** section for the following features:

- **Unauthorized Access**: Run a password manager to secure unauthorized access.
- **Secure API Check**: Verify the security of your APIs.
- **DNS Spoofing**: Protect against DNS spoofing attacks.
- **Data Breach**: Check for potential data breaches.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Implement encryption and decryption to mitigate DoS attacks.

## 🌐Team Information

The **Team Members** section displays the names and student IDs of the team members involved in this project.

- **Anmol Verma** - 22MIS0153
- **Azmil Ashuruff** - 22MIS0074
- **M Harish Gautham** - 22MIS0421
- **Ratnesh Chandra Pandey** - 22MIS0009
- **Prasoon Jha** - 22MIS0033

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Splash Screen**: The app begins with a splash screen displaying the project logo or image.
2. **Main Window**: Once the splash screen fades, the main window opens in full-screen mode with background images and interactive buttons.
3. **Toolkit Access**: Users can access various security tools via the buttons in the toolkit window.
4. **Team Members**: Clicking the "Team Members" button opens a window displaying the project team’s details.

## 🔐 Security Features

- **AES Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted to ensure confidentiality and security.
- **DDoS Mitigation**: The toolkit includes tools to handle potential DDoS attacks.
- **Access Logs**: All access attempts are logged, ensuring traceability.
